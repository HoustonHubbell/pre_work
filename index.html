                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hello , my name is Houston but my friends and family call me Hootie. 
                         A lifelong nickname.  I am from Minnesota and received an associates degree in business/entrepreneurship  
                         and I previously spent the last 6 years working for the Minnesota Twins Baseball team.  
                         Although it was a very fun and interesting job, long term career options were limited and I began searching for a different path.  
                         I married my wife in September of 2021 and we are expecting our first child on May 24(hopefully not before class ends), 
                         these life changes spurred me to move on from my job.  
                         The data science centered approach that baseball has taken opened my eyes to the value and utility that coding literacy 
                         has in the world today and decided that would be my next move to improve myself and career prospects. 
                         I look forward to working with, and learning from all of you. </p>

                    <h1>Family</h1>
                    <p>I come from a large family. I have three brothers and two sister.  
                        I was the 3rd born child, and my family lived in Pensacola, Florida at the time.  
                        My Father was a commander in the navy and we moved around a lot so i have siblings 
                        born in California, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.  
                        I am the only one born in Florida. We all moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota about 18 years ago and have been here ever since.  
                        My extended family is also large as i have 19 aunts and uncles and over 40 cousins.  
                        I recently became a Husband, marrying my wife Juliana in September of 2021.  
                        I will soon become a Father, in late May of 2022 we are expecting our first born son.</p>

                    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                    <p>I grew up playing any sport me and my siblings could think of.
                        From pickup football and basketball in the driveway, to volleyball and badmitten
                        we were always playing with eachother and inventing new games, like a homemade 
                        american ninja warrior course, or a game with airsoft guns we simply called "Hunter's and Prey"
                        I always love being outside to this day.  My wife Juliana and I will go on hikes
                        or walks through the famous Minneapolis Sculpture garden.
                        I have also always loved animals and dogs are number one in that group.
                        My parents have a black labrador and white German shepherd, but given that i am 
                        their favorite I consider them my own.  Going on walks with them is one of my favorite activities.
